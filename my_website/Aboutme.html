    <p>My name is David and I am seventeen years old. I live in California and I've lived here all my life.</p>
    <p> I plan on attending college once I graduate. I am going to pursue a career in physical therapy.</p>
    <p>I also plan on minoring in botany, for my own interest, not as a career.</p>
